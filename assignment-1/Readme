1.All the programs have been compiled,tested and were successfully executed.
2.Makefile is attached along in this submission. 
3.The readme contains the output/results for all the programs(3-4 runs) which was worked in the CSIL lab machines.
4.As per the instructions, prcess switching and thread swithcing were compiled on a single core machine. 
5.The results of those will be elaborated more in the report.


HOW TO COMPILE:

Individual compilation:
'make timer', 'make msys', 'make mfunction', 'make process_switch', 'make thread_switch'

Makefile (for group compilation):
make all


1. Output timer.c
